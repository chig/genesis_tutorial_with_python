# GENESIS tutorial for python 
GENESIS (GENeralized-Ensemble SImulation System) is Molecular Dynamics (MD) software developed by RIKEN. 

It is for MD and modeling for bimolecular systems such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, glycans, and their complexes.

Open source software distributed under the LGPLv3.

Please find more detal description from the GENESIS site.

The GitHub repository is prepared for tutorial using Google Colaboratory and/or Jupyter Lab.

While GENESIS can not be executed on such environment, we can learn a procedure of typical MD simulation and try little analysis.
